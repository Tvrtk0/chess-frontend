              <h2>Ultimate Method for Improvers</h2>
              <p>
                The Woodpecker Method is the name given by Axel Smith to a training system developed by his compatriot
                and co-author Hans Tikkanen
              </p>
              <p>
                After training with his method in 2010, Tikkanen achieved three GM norms within a seven-week period.

            <h2>No shortcuts for success. Progress requires hard work!</h2>
            <p>
              The quick explanation of the Woodpecker Method is that you need to solve a large number of puzzles in a
              row; then solve the same puzzles again and again, only faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&#39;s not a lazy shortcut to success â€“ hard work is required. But the reward can be re-programming your
              unconscious mind. Benefits include sharper tactical vision, fewer blunders, better play when in time
              trouble and improved intuition.
